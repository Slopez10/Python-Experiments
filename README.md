# My Python Experiments
This repository will contain initial code I create from the various courses on my journey to a PhD in *Computational Engineering*  at Mississippi State University.

## Plan 
Future plans for this repository include adding a smaple data file and a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebook that will interact with the file.

## About Me
My name is Sal Lopez, I currently work in the financial industry.  Using **Data Science** in my everyday work is critical for the questions and 
problems I am asked to answer or solve.

Some of the data science techniques and tools I've used are:

+ ETL (extract, transform, load)
+ Algorithm Design
+ Programming: R and Python
+ Statistical Tool: SAS
+ Predictive Analytics
+ Data wrangling and mining
+ Machine Learning

I've included a photograph of an ice cream sundae that was by far the best an biggest sugar crash I've ever had, "Cookie Monster Ice Cream":
